# Closures of Relations

In this assignment you'll implement functions in python to compute the closures of a relation.

The reflexive closure makes a relation reflexive  (and similarly for symmetric and transitive).

I've setup the `closures.py` file with a template for each of the functions to implement:
`warshall(A)` <-- transitive closure
`symmetric_closure(A)`
`reflexive_closure(A)`

Implement each of these functions. You can test your output by calling `pretty_print( ... )` to see what you output is.

When you're done, **commit** and **sync** your changes using the repository controls.  Here's a video demo for that:
